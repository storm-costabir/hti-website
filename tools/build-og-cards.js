   build-og-cards.js  —  a social card for every page that had the bare logo
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   WHY THIS EXISTS

   Twenty-three pages shared one og:image: images/brand/hti-logo.png, a red mark
   on white. Posted in a WhatsApp group - which is how these links actually
   travel - every one of them previewed as the same white square with no words
   on it. The fifteen programme pages were given proper cards in 879d424; these
   are the rest.

   Same 1200x630 as those, same furniture, so a link to hotels.html and a link
   to SUPER look like they come from the same place: HTI's own session
   photography under a dark wash, a red rule down the left edge, the eyebrow,
   the headline, the logo and "On site - 13+ languages - 410+ cities".

   The headline on each card is the phrase the page is trying to rank for, not
   its <title>. A title is written for a search results page, where the site
   name and the pipe earn their place; a card is read in a chat window at the
   size of a thumbnail, and everything that is not the promise gets in the way.

   TWO LAYOUTS

   Programme cards lead with an acronym, because the acronym is the product.
   Only two pages here have one - FoSTaC and POSH - so those use the same
   layout, and the rest use a plain headline set larger. Forcing an acronym
   onto "Find Training By Role" would have looked like a card with a hole in it.

   HOW TO RUN

     node tools/build-og-cards.js                 # draw all of them
     node tools/build-og-cards.js hotels fostac   # draw these
     node tools/build-og-cards.js --wire          # point the pages at them

   Drawing writes images/og/<slug>.jpg and changes nothing else, so the cards
   can be looked at before anything is published. --wire is the second step: it
   sets og:image, og:image:width, og:image:height, og:image:alt and
   twitter:image on each page, and is safe to run twice.

   Both halves live in one tool on purpose. og:image:alt is the card's own words
   read out to someone who cannot see it, so it has to say what the card says -
   keeping the alt text in the same table as the headline is what stops the two
   drifting apart the next time a card is reworded.

   Needs the bundled Node and Playwright, and a network connection the first
   time for the Google font:
