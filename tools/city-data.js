   Split out of build-city-pages.js so the copy can be reviewed and reworded
   without reading past the templating. The build script is the only consumer.

   HONESTY IS THE DESIGN CONSTRAINT HERE

   HTI has one office - A433 Vashi Plaza, Navi Mumbai - and trainers who
   travel. So exactly one entry below, Mumbai, sets `hq`, and only that page
   carries LocalBusiness schema with a real postal address. Every other city
   gets Service schema with areaServed, and says in its own copy that the
   trainers come from the Navi Mumbai HQ. Ten pages each implying a local
   branch would be both a lie and the fastest way to be read as a doorway
   farm.

   For the same reason no page invents a local client, a local case study or a
   local number. The only figures used are the ones HTI already publishes
   sitewide: trading since 2002, 300,000+ people trained, 410+ cities, 5
   countries, 13+ languages. "410+ cities" is what lets these pages say HTI
   has worked in the reader's city without naming a client HTI may not want
   named.

   FIELDS

   hq      Mumbai only. Switches the schema and the "we are down the road"
           copy.
   market  the paragraph that earns the page its place. What that city's
           hospitality industry is actually made of, and which of those
           problems the programmes are aimed at. A city page that is the
           sitewide copy with the name swapped is a doorway page and will be
           treated as one.
   langs   the languages that city's floor staff are most likely to work in.
           Phrased everywhere as "tell us which one", never as a promise that
           a named trainer is on the bench - HTI has run sessions in 13
           languages, which is not a guarantee of any one of them on any
           given date.
   progs   the shortlist, ordered. The first three are what that city's
           employers are most likely to be buying.

A single kilometre of Lower Parel or Bandra holds a five-star, a standalone fine-dine, four QSR counters and a corporate cafeteria &mdash; all hiring from the same pool, and all training that pool from scratch. Attrition is the tax everyone pays, and it falls hardest on the roles a guest actually meets: the steward, the receptionist, the counter executive. Then there is the commute. Staff who travel ninety minutes each way arrive with nothing left over for the guest unless somebody has taught them how to hold a shift together. That gap is the one HTI was built in, and it is why the programmes run on your own floor rather than in a banquet hall across town.',

Indiranagar, Koramangala and Whitefield add covers every quarter, brewpubs and casual-dining rooms compete on service as much as on food, and the cloud-kitchen model has quietly created a large workforce that never meets a guest but whose mistakes reach one anyway. Meanwhile the campuses at Electronic City and Whitefield run cafeterias and visitor lounges at a scale most hotels would recognise, staffed by teams with no hospitality background at all.
